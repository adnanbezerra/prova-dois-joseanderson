        <p> So, you've done a few courses and read a few books but still don't feel great about your relationship
            with JavaScript.

            How do you get better?

            Build things. Lots of things. Build 1,000 things. Keep it up and don't stop. Seriously.

            This has always been my advice. Just put in the work and you will get better.

            But Wes, what should I build? I have no ideas! Please don't make me do another todo app.

            Ideas, Eh? I've got lots! This is JavaScript30 â€” let's build 30 things together.

            <h3> WHO IS THIS FOR? </h3>
            <p> Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript
                fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library
                You should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. If you are new to
                JavaScript, or want to just get comfortable with the fundamentals, I'd recommend you take my
                BeginnerJavaScript.com course - use the code JAVASCRIPT30 for an extra $10 off.
                We learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and
                the whats that we use to solve them.
                We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These
                things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.
                These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you
                are stuck in console.log() land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!

        <p>These videos are free as a thank-you to everyone who has supported my premium courses as well as because I

            many of you become comfortable creating with JavaScript.

            While I've spent over 300 hours on JavaScript30, enough people find they really click with my teaching style
